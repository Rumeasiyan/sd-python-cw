## Coursework Title: Software Development I (2022/23)

### Module Information
- Module Code: 4COSC006C

### Description
This README file accompanies my submission for the Software Development I coursework. The coursework required me to create a Python program that predicts progression outcomes for students based on the number of credits at pass, defer, and fail. The program is divided into several parts, each with its specific requirements. Here is a summary of what I have implemented:

## Part 1 - Main Version
- A) Outcomes (Conditions): My program correctly predicts progression outcomes, including progress, module trailer, module retriever, and exclude.
- B) Validation: The program handles invalid inputs, such as wrong data types, credits outside the specified range, and incorrect total credits.
- C) Multiple Outcomes (Loop): The program allows the user to predict progression outcomes for multiple students in a loop.
- D) Histogram: Upon entering 'q' to quit, the program displays a histogram representing the progression categories and the total number of students.

## Part 2 - List (Extension)
I extended the program to save input progression data to a list and display the data.

## Part 3 - Text File (Extension)
I created a separate program (or extended the original program) to save input progression data to a text file and then access and display the stored data. The output format matches that of Part 2.

## Part 4 - Dictionary (Separate Program)
I created a separate program to save the input progression data to a dictionary, including unique student IDs, and then displayed the data.
